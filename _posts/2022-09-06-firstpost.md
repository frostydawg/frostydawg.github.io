Hello all and welcome to my first blog post! I am a cyber security professional who specializes in threat hunting and DFIR. I plan on using this blog to discuss various cyber security topics and to post CTF walkthroughs, custom tools, malware analysis and any other content related to cyber security and computer science.

About me - I have over 10 years of experience in various IT related fields with 7 of those specific to cybersecurity. I hold several different cyber certifications and am pursuing my masters degree in Information Security Engineering at SANS Technology Institute. I look forward to using this blog to discuss some github projects I am working on related to malware analysis and cyber deception.
